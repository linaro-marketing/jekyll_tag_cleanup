Over the last few weeks, Linaro has been carefully monitoring the Coronavirus situation. We have a duty of care for all attendees at our events. Health and safety is always our top priority.

With that in mind, it is with great regret that we have decided to cancel the upcoming Linaro Connect which was due to be held on 23-27 March 2020 at the Corinthia Hotel in Budapest, Hungary.

If you have any questions or require further assistance please contact [connect@linaro.org](mailto:connect@linaro.org) and we will work diligently to get back to you as quickly as possible.

We are working on finalizing the details for the next Linaro Connect and will communicate them in the near future.

We extend our sympathies to all those affected by the virus in China and around the world.

The Linaro Connect Planning Team
