We were disappointed to have to [cancel Linaro Connect Budapest 2020](/blog/linaro-connect-budapest-2020-cancelled/). We had lots of great technical sessions scheduled and as such, want to do all we can to repurpose as much of the content as possible.

We are therefore pleased to introduce Linaro Tech Days.

Linaro Tech Days are a series of technical sessions that will be presented live online for anyone to join. Recordings and slides will be made available on [our Resources page](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) for those who are not able to join.

When: Tuesday 24 - Wednesday 25 March 2020

There will be two tracks over 4 hours each day. We are planning on scheduling additional Linaro Tech Day sessions the following weeks and will announce more details shortly.

For more information about Linaro Tech Days, please go to [connect.linaro.org/linaro-tech-days](https://connect.linaro.org/linaro-tech-days/) where you can view the schedule. Please note that to access joining instructions for each remote session, you will need to register.

We hope to see you there!

The Linaro Connect Team
